## Why

The Go Extension with gopls currently uses `goimports` to sort imports and it doesn't provide any interface to change that.  
It is annoying when your Go project is maintained by both `vscode` and `goland` users due to diffierent import sort strategies.  
Especially when you are going to submit you code...  


## Extension Settings

there no any extension settings currently.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
